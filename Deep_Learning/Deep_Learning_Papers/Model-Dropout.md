### Simple summary

- Overfitting can be reduced by using “dropout” to prevent complex co-adaptations on the
training data.
- Dropout is a layer type. It has a parameter α∈(0,1). The output dimensionality of a dropout layer is equal to its input dimensionality. With a probability of α any neurons output is set to 0. At testing time, the output of all neurons is multiplied with α to compensate for the fact that no output is set to 0.
- Dropout can be interpreted as training an ensemble of many networks, which share weights. It can also be seen as a regularizer.
